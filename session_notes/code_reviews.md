2017-05-25 Code Review
---
* Code is read far more than it is written. 
* Giving feedback: 
    - remember the other person spent a lot of time on the code
    - open to other perspectives/solutions
    - be concrete & honest
    - tell them what they should do, avoid telling what not to do
* Receiving feedback: 
    - accept feedback and understand why they reacted the way they did
    - ok to disagree
    - don't be defensive 
    - ask reviewer to clarify if needed
* What does the reviewer look for? (top-down order)
    - understanding (if you don't, ask! => then the programmer can clarify confusions, 
      e.g. in comments, docstrings)
    - functionality (does it behave as intended?)
    - complexity (can it be made simpler?)
    - tests (are they appropriate and correct?)
    - minor things: 
        - naming
        - comments (explain why the code works the way it does!)
        - consistent style
* How to write review comments: 
    - get code review done within 1-2 days
    - resolve conflicts fast
* How to read review comments:
    - fix the code, try to make it better or clearer
    - use your judgement, don't blindly accept all suggestions

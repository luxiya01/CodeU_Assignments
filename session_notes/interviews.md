### What do they look for in coding interviews?
1. Data structure and algorithm: 
    - did you pick a good approach to the problem?
    - can you talk about multiple approaches?
    - can you talk about the complexities and trade off between different approaches? 
        - time & space complexities
    - can you give a sensible explanation about why you pick the solution you did? 
      and discuss its trade offs.
2. Coding: 
    - translate idea into working code
    - readable code?
    - sensible structure? 
3. Test: 
    - have test for all methods?
    - does it cover all returns? 
    - cover corner cases?
    - test larger inputs? 
        - (always interesting to explore this case!)
        - especially important when writing APIs
    - every test shall provide more coverage than the previous one!
    - what kind of things could be wrong with my program that my test 
      doesn't yet cover? 
    - interviewers are more interested in **how** you plan to test the code, 
      don't necessarily need to write out all testcases during an interview
        - ASK the interviewer what they want to see
    - use opensource **test coverage** tools! 
    - use descriptive test method names
    - don't put all tests in the same method...
